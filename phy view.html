        The Department of Physics at the National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur, was formed in 1960. Since its inception,
         the department has been recognized all over the country for its excellence. The department has consistently produced
         quality professionals in the field of physics and strived for excellence in research and development. The Department
         has at present 9 faculty members including DST-Inspire Faculty and 11 research scholars engaged in doctoral research.
         The Department actively participates in front-line research in several major areas of Physics including Solar Energy,
          Nuclear scattering and Supersymmetry, Mathematical Physics, Holography and holographic optical element, Speckle
          Meterology, Condensed Matter Physics, Plasma Physics, Computational Physics and Spectroscopy.At present department
           offer 2 years Master of Science (Physics) Programme as well as a Ph.D. Programme with specialization in various
           major areas of Physics. The Department also participates in teaching Engineering Physics to B.Tech. (Hons.)
           students of all the disciplines namely- Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and
            Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Production and Industrial Engineering,
             Mechanical Engineering and Metallurgical & Materials Engineering of the Institute. Our M.Sc. students are
              ranking good in national level competitive exams like CSIR-NET, GATE, JEST as well as in the INSPIRE
               Fellow scheme offered by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), India.
