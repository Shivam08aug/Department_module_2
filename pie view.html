      <p>
        The Department of Production & Industrial Engineering was started in year 1988 with the name of “Production Engineering & Management”.
         The name of this department was changed to Production & Industrial Engineering in the year 2007. The department was accredited
         by NBA in 2009. This core department has a sanctioned strength of 16 (Sixteen) faculty members with flexible faculty structure.
          Presently, there are 02 Professor, 03 Associate professors and 08 Assistant Professors. Every faculty member has received
          doctorate degree in different research areas. The department is running a UG course for B. Tech. (Hons.) degree in Production
          and industrial Engineering and a PG course in Manufacturing Systems Engineering as well as Ph. D. program in various streams
           of Production and Industrial Engineering. The Department is currently developing different engineering laboratories like
           CAD/CAM Lab., Advanced Manufacturing and Flexible manufacturing systems Lab., Non- Traditional Manufacturing lab, and
            Industrial Engineering & Ergonomics lab and Central workshop. Time to time curricula/syllabus is upgraded as per the
             market and technology requirement. The department has also proposed to start a new PG course in Production Management
             which will cater to the current industrial need.
